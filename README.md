# projects
ðŸ‘‹ Dear Interviewer,
Thank you for taking the time to explore my work. My portfolio features projects built with 
- **Angular** (including authentication, route guards, RxJS, and modular architecture)
- as well as core **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS projects** that highlight responsive design and interactive UI development.
- RESTAPI backend projects 

Each project reflects real-world scenarios, clean coding practices, and performance optimization. I'm happy to walk you through the code, design choices, or architecture in detail during our discussion.

Best regards,
Prasanna Pinnam
